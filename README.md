# NeuralNetwork-Numpy  
Building various neural networks using **numpy**.  
All networks run on MNIST for 50 epochs, 60000 images as train data and 10000 images as test data.  
## 1. Linear_2  
* including 2 linear layers  
* uses Sigmoid as the activation function  
* uses MSE as the loss function  
* neurons: 784 - 100 - 10  
epochs when reaching 95% accuracy: 14  
final accuracy: >97%  
average time per epoch: 26.802s
